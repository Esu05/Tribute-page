# Tribute-page
 Tribute Page! This is a fun way to showcase someone who inspires me and pay homage to their contributions. For this project, I chose to create a tribute to Atal Bihari Vajpayee. 
Features of My Tribute Page:
Responsive Design: The page looks great on both desktop and mobile devices.
Biography Section: A brief overview of their journey and accomplishments.
Links: Relevant links for those who want to dive deeper into their story.
Technologies Used:
HTML for the structure
CSS for styling

Creating this tribute page helped me practice my HTML and CSS skills, and I learned more about how to structure a webpage for clarity and aesthetic appeal. It was also a nice opportunity to research and appreciate the person I chose to honor.

Feel free to check it out and let me know what you think!

Happy coding! ðŸ’»âœ¨
